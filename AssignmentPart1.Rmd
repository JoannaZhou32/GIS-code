Assignment Part1
Analysis the leave rate of Brexit in London
An assessment of the benefits and drawbacks of GUI vs Command line generated maps
R Studio and ArcMap are two main software used in this project. Both of them have some advantages and disadvantages.

First, R is an open source software, the knowledge and example of each package can be easily and clearly find in 'help'. Moreover, after modifying the code, we do not need to run the rode all the way from start to finish, just run the specific line. The visualization of R is better, clearer, and easier for people to understand. What's more, in R, interactive map can be plotted.

However, R has a relatively poor processing ability for big data, R will run very slowly and is easy to get stuck. In addition, R require people have to understand the manual and confirm the validity of the functions. As for the visualisation of R, the position of title, legend, and compass is limit. And when plotting the Choropleth Map, names of London Borough cannot be added.

ArcMap is the mainstream visualization software. For beginners, it is easier to process spatial data with ArcMap. In ArcMap, each layer corresponds to a piece of data, and does not affect each other when processed. Besides, it is easily insert title, legend and compass in. Moreover, in the final visualization process, the position the texts and legends is very flexible, can be moved freely.

In the other hand, the drawbacks of ArcMap is existing. Because ArcMap is not a code based software, if people make a mistake during the visualization or want to modify it, they have to restart all over again. What's more, if the size of map is changed in Data View, then the size of map will be changed in Layout View. The process of ArcMap is cumbersome when people want to map frequently.
An assessment of the data sources used in their generation
The data is downloaded from the London Datastore. The data was collected by the Greater London Authority (GLA). These two are the authorities directly under the British government. There are 382 observations and 21 variables in the data. The data itself consists of two parts, one is the data of the whole UK, and the other is the data of London Borough, this avoids errors when doing data analysis.
A review of cartographic good practice and an assessment of your maps as presented
Both figures are based on the Brexit data. Whether in ArcMap or R, the first step is to merge information in London data borough and Eu referendum according to the code of London Borough. The subject of this project is to vote for the Brexit in different boroughs of London. So the output variable selects the percentage of leave. 
The turnout rate is divided into five parts. The turnout rate is indicated by the shade of the colour. The darker the colour, the more support for the Brexit. The lighter the colour, the less support for Brexit. As can be seen from the two figures, in the central part of London, most people do not agree with Brexit; in the suburbs, most people are in favour of Brexit.
